1. Rationale
The Copyrights plugin is intended for Piwigo users who want to protect their
work with copyrights. The plugin comes with an administration area where
several copyrights can be created. When these copyrights are created, they can
be added to media elements of Piwigo via drop down menus (e.g. in the Batch
Manager)


2. Installation
To install the Copyrights plugin, go to the plugin management in the
administration area of your Piwigo install.
* Administration -> Plugins -> Manage -> Other plugins available
Then search for 'Copyrights' and click 'Install'. Afterwards go to your plugin
list and install and activate the plugin.
* Search: 'Copyrights' -> Install -> Plugins list -> Install -> Activate


3. Managing copyrights
To manage (create or edit) copyrights, go to the plugin management in the
administration area of your Piwigo install, and click the Copyrights plugin.
This will give you a page where you can manage your copyrights.
